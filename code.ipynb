Because of the implementation of the loss function we will see in the next section, we are not going to have the cosine similarity as output of our Siamese network, but rather $v_1$ and $v_2$. We will add the cosine distance step once we reach the classification step. \n",

Mathematically, we are trying to maximize the following.\n",
